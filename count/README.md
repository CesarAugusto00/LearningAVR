# ðŸ”¢ 7-Segment Display Counter (1 to 5) with ATmega168 (SimulIDE)

## Description

This project implements a simple counter that displays numbers **1 to 5** on a **7-segment display** using an **ATmega168** microcontroller. Developed and tested in **SimulIDE**, it lights up the appropriate segment pattern for each digit, with a pause between each change. After reaching 5, the count resets and repeats.

## Features

- Displays numbers 1 to 5 on a 7-segment display.
- Uses software delays to control timing between digits.
- Runs on an ATmega168 at a simulated 1 MHz internal clock.
- Fully simulated in **SimulIDE** (no physical hardware required).
- Written in C using the **AVR-GCC** toolchain.

## Hardware (Simulated)

- **Microcontroller:** ATmega168
- **Display:** Common cathode 7-segment display 
- **Clock Source:** Internal 1 MHz oscillator (simulated)
- **Resistors:** Series resistors between PORTB and 7-segment segments (for realism in SimulIDE)

## How It Works

- Each number (1 through 5) is displayed by outputting the corresponding segment pattern to PORTB.
- A delay is introduced between digits using `_delay_ms()` for readability.
- The pattern sequence repeats indefinitely.

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in **SimulIDE**.
2. Load the compiled `.hex` file into the ATmega168 microcontroller.
3. Connect the 7-segment display segments (Aâ€“G) to PORTB (PB7â€“PB1).
4. Run the simulation to observe the counter in action.

## Requirements

- SimulIDE (tested with v1.0.0 or later)
- AVR-GCC and avr-libc (for compiling the code)
